# WHAT

This is a straw-man API design for a set of autonomous air-traffic-control installations which control a number of drones each.

# WHY

Demonstrates what shape the API could be, and what features might be needed by an actual implementation.

# WHERE

Hosting TBC.

# HOW

Not a real implementation; there is no "how".
